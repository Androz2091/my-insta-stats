# My Insta Stats

My Insta Stats is a web app that allows you to explore the content of your Instagram data package (similar to [Discord Data Package Explorer](https://github.com/Androz2091/discord-data-package-explorer)).

## ðŸš§ Under development

This project is under development. It works, but there are a lot of things that can be improved. It is just a POC and feel free to make a PR or to fork the project to make something better. Plus, as I'm not an active user on Instagram, my package is almost empty so I can't test a lot of things...
